# Write code to keep track of the score of a game of bowling. It should have two methods: roll which takes in the number of pins knocked down, and score which is called at the end and returns the total game score.

# take a number in and store it

# score = 0
# puts "how many pins did you hit? Your number must be bewteen 0-10"  
# new_score = score + gets.to_i
# p new_score



# ask a user how many pins they hit the second time and add it to the first number they gave you

# puts "how many pins did you hit on your second role? Still needs to be between 0-10"
# new_score += gets.to_i
# pp "Your new score is #{new_score}"



# create the ability to randomly select a number between 0-10

# random_number = rand(0...10)
# pp random_number



# use the random number created above and store it as "pins knocked down". 

pins_knocked_down = rand(o...10)
pp pins_knocked_down
